We are given the following sequence:

- `S1 = N;`
- `S2 = S1 + 1;`
- `S3 = 2*S1 + 1;`
- `S4 = S1 + 2;`
- `S5 = S2 + 1;`
- `S6 = 2*S2 + 1;`
- `S7 = S2 + 2;`

Your task is to write a program, that by given `N` and `M`, finds the M<sup>th</sup> member of the sequence

# Input

- Read from the standard input
- On the first line find the numbers `N` and `M`, separated by a whitespace

# Output

- Print to the standard output
- On the single line print the M<sup>th</sup> member of the sequence

# Sample tests


| Input | Output | Explanation |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| 2 4   | 4      | 2, 3, 5, 4  |
