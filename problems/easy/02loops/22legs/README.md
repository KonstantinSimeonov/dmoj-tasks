Skoki likes to count legs. All kinds of legs! Bear legs, human legs,
chicken legs.

Skoki is also a magician. He once made an incantation which sent him to
another universe. There chickens have `7` legs, bears have `2` and
humans have `5`.

The inhabitants of that universe were **really big** and Skoki was able
to see only their legs because everything else was hidden by clouds.
Skoki decided to count the legs and calculate the number of possible
combinations of chicken, bears and humans.
