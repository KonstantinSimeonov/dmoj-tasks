Problem 2 – Tribonacci
----------------------

The Tribonacci sequence is a sequence in which every next element is made by the sum of the previous three elements from the sequence.

Write a computer program that finds the **N**<sup>th</sup> element of the Tribonacci sequence, if you are given the first three elements of the sequence and the number **N**. Mathematically said: with given T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> – you must find T<sub>n</sub>.

# Input

- Read from the standard input

- The values of the first three Tribonacci elements will be given on the first three input lines.

- The number **N** will be on the fourth line. This is the number of the consecutive element of the sequence that must be found by your program.

- The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

# Output

- Print to the standard output

- At the only output line you must print the **N**<sup>th</sup> element of the given Tribonacci sequence.

# Constraints

- The values of the first three elements of the sequence will be integers between -2 000 000 000 and 2 000 000 000.
- The number **N** will be a positive integer between 1 and 15 000, inclusive.
