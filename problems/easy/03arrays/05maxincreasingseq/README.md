Write a program that finds the length of the **maximal increasing sequence** in an array of **N** integers.

# Input

Read from the standard input

- On the first line you will receive the number **N**
- On the next **N** lines the numbers of the array will be given

# Output

Print to the standard output

- Print the length of the **maximal increasing sequence**

# Constraints
- 1 <= **N** <= 1024
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

# Sample tests
