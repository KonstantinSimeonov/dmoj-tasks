One day a signal from space was registered. Scientists managed to record
the signal as a sequence of `N` symbols. It turned out that due to a
technical difficulty some symbols have been repeated. Help the
scientists by writing a program which removes consecutive repetitions of
symbols, decoding the message.

# Input

Input data is read from the standard input

-   On the only input line a message is given

# Output

Print to the standard output

-   Print the decoded message

# Constraints

-   The length of the message will be no more than `10000` symbols
-   Message consists of digits and latin letters (upper and lower case)

# Sample tests

## Input
```
Hello
```

## Output
```

```

## Input
```
