# Businessmen

## Description

Consider a meeting of **N** businessmen sitting around a circular table.

To start the meeting, they must shake hands. Each businessman shakes the hand of **exactly one other** businessman. All handshakes happen **simultaneously**. We say that the shake is perfect if **no arms cross each other**.
