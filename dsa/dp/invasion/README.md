# Invasion

## Description

> During the Clone Wars, Joro and Goshi were among the Jedi
> who defended the galaxy from the rising droid hordes.

Goshi and Joro were very capable jedi. They worked very well both with the lightsabers and with the Force. But what they lack is intelligence, and that's why Master Jedi Yoda constantly bragged them.

Since Yoda saw their potential, however small, he decided to assign them the task of planning the invasion of Planet Droudia. Because Drogheda is one of the best-guarded planets in the territory of Drought, the attack should be planned very carefully. Joro and Goshi had the following task - they had to calculate the ways in which clone ships (Jedi soldiers) could reach Droudia, passing through hibernation. When ships in hibernation ** are traveling in a queue **, they can not be overtaken and have to wait - if a ship ** S1 is before a ship S2 ** and a ship ** S2 moves at a faster speed ** , Then ** S2 decreases its velocity to become equal to S1 **. In this case, ** S1 and S2 make a ** group of ships.

Since Master Jedi Yoda was extremely wise and not so-bad, he decided to give the young Jedi ships at different speeds - each ship had a ** unique velocity of movement **.

Since Joro and Goshi are not particularly smart, they need your help to plan the attack properly. They have to calculate the number of groups in the N number of vessels and the number of groups in G, how many are the different variants on which G can be formed in a number of groups.

## Input

The input will be read from the console.

- On the console row you will find 2 numbers - N and G
  N - Number of ships
  - G - the number of groups to be formed

## Exit

The output will be output to the console.

- The only number - the number of variants of the groups consisting of the N vessel and the groups are exactly G in number per module 300481.

## Limits

- ** N ** will be between ** 2 ** and ** 2500 ** inclusive.
- ** G ** will be between ** 2 ** and ** N ** inclusive

## Examples

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------
| 13 2 | 263854 |
