Steve is imprisoned in Telerik Academy and punished to count to
infinity.

You know how that goes. When you reach `N` and you start to forget what
is the next number, what was the previous number and so on.

Write a program which prints **ten** numbers after a given `N`.

# Input

You will receive an array with a single element, the number `N`, as only
parameter of the `solve(args)` function

-   *Note*: see sample tests

# Output

Print to the standard output, i.e. with `console.log()` method

-   Print ten lines with numbers

# Constrains

-   `N` can have up to `1000` digits

# Sample tests

## Input
```
solve(["3"]);
```

## Output
```
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10
    11
    12
    13
```

## Input 
```
solve(["90"]);
```

## Output
```
    91
    92
    93
    94
    95
    96
    97
    98
    99
    100
```

## Input
```
solve(["996"]);
```

## Output 
```
    997
    998
    999
    1000
    1001
    1002
