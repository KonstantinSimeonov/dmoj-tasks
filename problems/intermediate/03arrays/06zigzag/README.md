You are given numbers **N** and **M**. They form a matrix.

_Example_ with N = 3 and M = 4

```
1  4  7 10
4  7 10 13
7 10 13 16
```

_Example_ with N = 5 and M = 6

```
 1  4  7 10 13 16
 4  7 10 13 16 19
 7 10 13 16 19 22
10 13 16 19 22 25
13 16 19 22 25 28
```

A zig-zag path in the matrix is as follows:

<img src="" />


You task is to find the sum of the path


# Input

Read from the standard input

- On the single line of the input, read **N** and **M**, separated by a space

# Output

Print to the standard output

- On the single line of the output, print the sum of the path
