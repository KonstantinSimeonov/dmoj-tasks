# Binary tree

Let `P` be an integer, bigger than `2`.
Integers are written in the vertices of the infinity binary tree in the following way:
- in the root of the tree it is written `1`
- if in any vertex of the tree it is written `X`, therefore its left child contains `P * X` and its right child contains `P * X + 1`
For example, if `P = 3` then the beginning of the tree looks in the following way:

A number is called **pretty** if it can be presented in a single way as a sum of two different numbers, which appear in the tree vertices.
Write a program, which determines whether the given numbers are **pretty**.

## Input
- Input is read from the console
  - **P** is read from the first line
  - Several numbers will be given on the second line
    - Separated by spaces
	- Those are the numbers you must check

## Output
- Output should be printed on the console
  - On a single line of the standard output for every number the program must write `1` if the number is **pretty** and `0` if it is not.
    - Separated by spaces

## Constraints
- 2 < **P** <= 50
- 0 < **each given number** < 10<sup>18</sup>
- **Time limit**: **0.05s**
- **Memory limit**: **16 MB**
