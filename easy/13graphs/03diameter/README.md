A tree structure consisted of **N** nodes is given. Nodes are numbered **from 0 to N-1**.
The length of a path between two edges is the sum of the lengths of all the edges between them. Find the length of the longest path in the tree.

# Input

- Read from the standard input
- **N** is read from the first line
- From each of the next **N - 1** lines an edge is given as 3 numbers separated by spaces
  - The first two numbers are the numbers of the nodes that the edge connects
  - The third number is the length of the edge

# Output
- Print to the standard output
- Print a number on a single line
  - The length of the longest path between nodes in the tree

# Constraints
- **1** <= **N** < **50 000**
